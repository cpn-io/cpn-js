## Declaration Panel

The **Declaration Panel** is located under the Project tree. It consists of five tabs (BatchOrdering, Globref, Color, Var, ML) classifying the declarations in a more detailed way than in the Project tree.

You can create or delete new lines by bringing up the right-click menu and selecting the appropriate option or by using the buttons **New** | **Delete** on the top of the Declaration Panel.

The **BatchOrdering** tab replicates the list of declarations in the Declarations entry in the Project tree. All the changes made in the Declarations entry in the Project tree are immediately reflected in the BatchOrdering tab.

You can add or delete declarations by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate option or by using the buttons **New** | **Delete** on the top of the Declaration Panel.

Navigating between the lines can be made by pressing **Shift+Up** / **Shift+Down** or by pressing the buttons on the top of the Declaration Panel.
