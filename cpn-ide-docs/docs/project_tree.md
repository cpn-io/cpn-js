# Project tree 

Project tree is labeled with the name of the net. In the picture below, the net is named **mynet-for-sim-sub.cpn**.

There are two more points below the name of the net:

**Step** means the number of steps that have executed in a simulation.

**Time** means the current model time.

Project tree contains a number of entries that provide some information about a net and tools for creating and editing it. Click on the black triangle next to the name to open the entry, if it is not already opened.

## Options

The **Options** entry in the Project tree provides an overview of the options that are related to a particular net.

You may choose an option by putting a tick on it.

#### Real Timestamp

#### Binding Element Fairness

#### Global BE Fairness

#### Output directory 

The Output directory option determines where various kinds of output files will be saved. The default output directory is indicated by the text <same as model>, but the default output directory is actually <model-dir>/output/ where <model-dir> is the directory in which the model is saved.

To change the output directory for a net, edit the text of the option. To enter text edit mode, simply click on the text.

### Performance report statistics

The Performance report statistics options are used to determine which statistics should be included in different kinds of performance output. A check mark next to a statistic indicates that the statistic will be included in the appropriate report.
