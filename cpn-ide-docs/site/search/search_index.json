In the picture below, the net is named mynet-for-sim-sub.cpn . There are two more points below the name of the net: Step means the number of steps that have executed in a simulation. Time means the current model time. Project tree contains a number of entries that provide some information about a net and tools for creating and editing it. Click on the black triangle next to the name to open the entry, if it is not already opened. Options The Options entry in the Project tree provides an overview of the options that are related to a particular net. You may choose an option by putting a tick on it. Real Timestamp Binding Element Fairness Global BE Fairness Output directory The Output directory option determines where various kinds of output files will be saved. The default output directory is indicated by the text , but the default output directory is actually /output/ where is the directory in which the model is saved. To change the output directory for a net, edit the text of the option. To enter text edit mode, simply click on the text. Performance report statistics The Performance report statistics options are used to determine which statistics should be included in different kinds of performance output. A check mark next to a statistic indicates that the statistic will be included in the appropriate report. The Simulation performance report options are used to select the statistics to be included in simulation performance reports. The Replication performance report options are used to select the statistics to be included in replication performance reports","title":"Project tree"},{"location":"project_tree.html#project-tree","text":"Project tree is labeled with the name of the net.
