It consists of five tabs (BatchOrdering, Globref, Color, Var, ML) classifying the declarations in a more detailed way than in the Project tree. Operations for creating, deleting and editing declarations contained in these tabs are the same for each of these tabs: You can create or delete new lines by bringing up the right-click menu and selecting the appropriate option or by using the buttons + New | - Delete on the top of the Declaration Panel. To edit a declaration simply click on the text to enter text edit mode. You can also edit it using the ML editor . Navigating between the lines can be made by pressing Shift+Up / Shift+Down or by pressing the buttons on the top of the Declarations Panel. BatchOrdering The BatchOrdering tab replicates the list of declarations in the Declarations entry in the Project tree. All changes made in the Declarations entry in the Project tree appear concurrently in the BatchOrdering tab. Globref The Globref tab contains a list of reference variables. There must be a corresponding block Globref in the Project tree if you want to create a new reference variable within this tab. Color The Color tab contains a list of color sets. Var Var tab contains variables that are used in CP-net inscriptions. ML ML tab contains value declarations corresponding to the Standard priorities block in the Project tree.

You can either load an existing net or create a new one. To create a new net, click on New Project . To load a net, click on Open project and select the desired net. Tools Creating objects One of the instruments for creating net objects is the mouse right-click button menu. You can bring it up by clicking the right mouse button in the editor area. To create a new place or transition , select the corresponding option of the menu. Having created an object, you can create the next one by putting the cursor on the first object and bringing up the menu with the right mouse button click. A place can be related only to a transition and a transition can be related only to a place. It's impossible to make an arc between two transitions or two places. To create an arc : - click on a place or transition to bring up the menu select the arrow icon draw the arc to the object you wish to connect to. Creating new subpage When a CP-net uses a substitution transition the logic that the transition represents must be kept somewhere. It is kept on a page called a subpage . A page that contains a substitution transition is called a superpage . To create a new subpage , select the corresponding option in the menu The subpage created has a corresponding mark, it looks like this: Moving selected objects to subpage If you need to make a group of objects to be the objects of a subpage, use the menu: Press the lasso icon (the top icon) Select objects to be replaced to the subpage by drawing the lasso with the pointer Press the icon in the middle (\"Move selected objects to subpage\") Deleting objects To delete a place, an arc or a transition put the cursor on the object to be removed, bring up the right-click menu and select the bin icon. You can also remove several objects at once using the menu in the upper left corner of the Editor View. To delete a group of objects: - Press the lasso icon (the top icon) - Select objects to be removed by drawing the lasso with the pointer - Press the bin icon Inscriptions Adding inscriptions To add an inscription, click on the place, transition, or arc where you want to add the inscription. This activates the text edit mode for the object you have clicked on. Immediately after creating a place, transition, or arc you are also in the text edit mode, and can add the first inscription right away. To switch between inscriptions of an object, put the cursor on the object and use the Tab key. Place inscriptions Place inscriptions are created when you add/edit inscriptions for places. There are three inscriptions that may be associated with a place. Place name inscription \u2013 optional. The place name inscription is an optional label that identifies the place, and it may contain any sequence of characters. Color set inscription \u2013 required. The color set inscription determines the color set, i.e. the type of all the tokens that can be put in the place. Default color set inscription Initial marking inscription \u2013 optional. The initial marking inscription is a multiset expression that specifies the initial tokens for a place. Default initial marking inscription Transition inscriptions Transition inscriptions are created when you add/edit inscriptions for transitions. There are five inscriptions that may be associated with a transition. All are optional: Transition name inscription Condition inscription Default condition inscription Time inscription Default time inscription Code segment inscription Default code inscription Priority inscription Default priority inscription Arc inscriptions Arcs have only one inscription \u2014 the arc inscription. An arc inscription is a CPN ML expression that evaluates to a multiset or a single object. Default arc inscription ML editor ML editor is a tab for creating declarations using ML code. It's easier to write a declaration in the ML editor if the declaration is very complex. Tabs The number of tabs related to the Editor View depends on how many pages have been created. Clicking on a page in the Project tree (block \"Pages\") opens the corresponding tab in the Editor View. You can switch between the pages either by clicking on the names of pages in the Project tree or by clicking on the tabs in the Editor View Diagram zooming To zoom in or out, hold the Ctrl key and scroll the mouse wheel. Resizing objects To resize an object: - put the pointer on any corner of the object - when you see the pointer as two-way arrow, drag the corner of the object to get desired size and form. Diagram moving To move a diagram across the Editor View, set the pointer in the free space of the Editor View, hold down the left mouse key and move the pointer. The diagram will repeat the movements of the pointer. To move a particular object, put the cursor in the object, hold down the left mouse key and move the pointer. While moving the object, you can see magnetic guidelines (orange lines in the picture below). Magnetic guidelines are horizontal and vertical lines which can be used for aligning your objects during the graphical editing of the net.","title":"Editor view"},{"location":"editor_view.html#editor-view","text":"Editor View is the workspace for creating a net.

In the picture below, the net is named mynet-for-sim-sub.cpn . There are two more points below the name of the net: Step means the number of steps that have executed in a simulation. Time means the current model time. Project tree contains a number of entries that provide some information about a net and tools for creating and editing it. Click on the black triangle next to the name to open the entry, if it is not already opened. Options The Options entry in the Project tree provides an overview of the options that are related to a particular net. You may choose an option by putting a tick on it. Real Timestamp Binding Element Fairness Global BE Fairness Fix a bug which caused instances of the first enabled transition instance to have slightly higher probability of being chosen and instances of the last slightly lower when using global binding element fairness. Especially visible if you have just two transitions with one enabled binding, where one would be starved if the other was always enabled. When using global binding element fairness, sometimes the transition would appear more than once in the simulation report. Output directory The Output directory option determines where various kinds of output files will be saved. The default output directory is indicated by the text same as model , but the default output directory is actually model-dir/output/ where model-dir is the directory in which the model is saved. To change the output directory for a net, edit the text of the option. To enter text edit mode, simply click on the text.
