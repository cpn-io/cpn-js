## RQ-026. Model changes
- a. The model can be changed through
  - a.i. The graphical editor (nodes, edges and their properties shown in the graphical editor)
  - a.ii. The project panel (editing ML definitions in the tree structure, model properties)
  - a.iii. The ML view tabs
  - a.iv. The properties panel
  - a.v. Text editors for ML code for a specific node in the tree structure of the cpn model
  - a.vi. **TODO Dirk: provide picture/user story for intended interactions**
- b. Upon model changes and model import, the model has to be validated for correctness of
  - b.i. the ML definitions in the CPN model
  - b.ii. the properties of transitions (guard, time annotation, priority, input/output/action), places (colorset, initial marking), and edges (edge label) for being valid ML in the context of the definitions provide in the model 
  - b.iii. the correctness of the linking of subpage transitions to subpages and places to interface places
