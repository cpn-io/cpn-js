Communication between CPN Tools simulator and applet
====================================================

The Java files in this directory can be compiled with J2SE 1.4.2 which
can be downloaded from:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp

The applet in this directory and CPN Tools must be running on the same
computer in order for the communication to work.

There are two sample nets that can be used with the applet. In the
DiningPhilosophers_COMM.cpn net, code segments are used to establish
communication between CPN Tools and the applet. In the
DiningPhilosophers_COMM_Mon.cpn net, user-defined monitors are used to
establish communication between CPN Tools and the applet.

To run the applet with DiningPhilosophers_COMM.cpn
1) Start CPN Tools
2) Load the sample net DiningPhilosophers_COMM.cpn
3) Apply the Rewind tool to the net to return to the initial marking 
4) Load the applet on the computer where CPN Tools is running, e.g. by
   double-clicking on the applet.html file
5) Apply the Single Step simulation tool to the Waiting transition
6) Enter 9000 as the Port Number in the GUI for the applet
7) Press the Start button in the applet
8) Run a simulation of the CP-net and observe how the GUI for the
   applet reflects the marking of the CP-net.


To run the applet with DiningPhilosophers_COMM_Mon.cpn
1) Start CPN Tools
2) Load the sample net DiningPhilosophers_COMM_Mon.cpn
3) Apply the Rewind tool to the net to return to the initial marking 
4) Load the applet on the computer where CPN Tools is running, e.g. by
   double-clicking on the applet.html file
5) Apply the Play tool to the System page (the simulation feedback
   will not be updated until a connection has been made to the applet
   -- see steps 6 and 7)
6) Enter 9000 as the Port Number in the GUI for the applet
7) Press the Start button in the applet
8) Observe how the GUI for the applet reflects the marking of the CP-net.
